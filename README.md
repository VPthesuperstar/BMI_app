The BMI (Body Mass Index) Calculator App is a mobile application that helps users check whether their body weight is healthy according to their height and weight.
The app takes input from the user, calculates their BMI, and displays the result along with a health category such as Underweight, Normal, Overweight, or Obese, using an interactive and responsive UI.
